/**
 * An {@code Error} is a subclass of {@code Throwable}
 * that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application
 * should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
 * The {@code ThreadDeath} error, though a "normal" condition,
 * is also a subclass of {@code Error} because most applications
 * should not try to catch it.
 * <p>
 * A method is not required to declare in its {@code throws}
 * clause any subclasses of {@code Error} that might be thrown
 * during the execution of the method but not caught, since these
 * errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.
 *
 * That is, {@code Error} and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked
 * exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.
